/*@ \section{Abstract}
This file contains an environment-based \K semantic definition of LAMBDA++, an
extension of the LAMBDA language (defined in Tutorial 1) with a \texttt{callcc}
construct.  The objective here is to further disseminate some of the features
of the K framework, in particular to illustrate how popular environment-based
and closure-based semantics can be defined in K.

For notational/kompilation/krun simplicity and to avoid OS errors, we continue
to write LAMBDA and lambda as names for modules and program extensions,
respectively, in the sequel. */

/*@ To restrict the default program parser invoked by krun, namely kast,
to only parse proper LAMBDA++ programs no matter what other syntactic
constructs we add to Exp later on in the semantics, we put the actual program
syntax in a module with the suffix -SYNTAX.  This issue was discussed in more
detail in Lesson 2 of this tutorial.  In short, the parser generated by kompile
to be used by kast will be by default built only based on the syntax in this
module.  Type kompile --help to see how to tell the parser which syntax to use.

/*@ One thing you may want to do, now that the entire syntax is in one
place, is to play with precedences.  This way, you can make kompile
generate the parser you want for your programs, so that you won't have to
put lots of parentheses in your programs. */

/*@ \section{Semantics}
The next module contains the semantics of all the LAMBDA++ constructs,
in the order in which their syntax was declared above. */

/*@ \subsection{The K Results}
We should not forget to define the results of our computations.
Here is a rule of thumb: whenever you have any strictness attributes, your
should also define some K results.  Or even simpler: \textit{always define your
results!}  (unless you define a theoretical semantics, for analysis but not
for execution purposes, you will need to define your results) */

  syntax KResult ::= Val

/*@ \subsection{Configuration}
Since LAMBDA++ is such a simple language, its configuration is minimal
for an environment-based semantics: it only contains the \textsf{k} cell,
an environment cell, and a store cell.  An environment binds variable names
to locations, and a store binds locations to values. */

                  <k color="green"> $PGM:Exp </k>

                  <store color="red"> .Map </store>
                </T>

//@ Recall that \$PGM is where the program is placed by krun after parsing.

/*@ \subsection{Closures}
In environment-based definitions of lambda-calculi, $\lambda$-abstractions
evaluate to \textit{closures}.  A closure is like a $\lambda$-abstraction,
but it also holds the environment in which it was declared.  This way, when
invoked, a closure knows where to find in the store the values of all the
variables that its body expression refers to.
To invoke a closure, we need to switch to closure's environment, then create
a new binding for closure's parameter, then evaluate the closure's body, and
then switch back to caller's environment.  */

The environment-recovery computation item defined below is useful in many
semantics, like it was above.  It is so useful, that there are discussions
in the \K team to add it to the set of pre-defined \K features. */

/*@ \subsection{Arithmetic Constructs}
Not much to say here.  They have exactly the same semantics as in LAMBDA and
IMP.  Note that we let it in programmer's hands to check that the denominator
of a division is different from zero.  If a division-by-zero is issued, then
completely non-deterministic result can happen depending upon what back-end
one uses for the K tool.  Currently, Maude is used and Maude gets stuck
with a term of the form \texttt{I /Int 0}, but one should not rely on that.
If you want to catch division-by-zero in the semantics, instead of letting
the back-end do whatever it wants, you should add a side condition to the
division rule. */

To save the number of locations needed to evaluate $\mu X . E$, we replace it
with a special closure which binds $X$ to a fresh location holding the closure
itself.  This has the same effect as binding $X$ to a reference that points
back to the fixed-point. */
