# current worK

All of my Rholang in K work lives in `/GroundedRho`. As the name suggests, this work started as an implementation of the [Rho Calculus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066105051893) with ground terms (Bool, Int, String), but is quickly evolving into a full-scale implementation of Rholang. 

For [all things Rholang](https://github.com/rchain/rchain/tree/dev/rholang), for [all things RChain](https://github.com/rchain/rchain), and for [all things K](https://github.com/kframework).
