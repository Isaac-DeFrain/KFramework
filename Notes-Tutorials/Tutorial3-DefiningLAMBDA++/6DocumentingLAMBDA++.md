# [Tutorial 3 - Lesson 6]()
## Wrapping Up and Documenting LAMBDA++

### To learn:
* Documenting and cleaning up semantics

In this lesson, we wrap up and nicely document LAMBDA++.  In doing so, we also take the freedom to reorganize the semantics a bit, to make it look better.

See the `lambda-annotated.k` file, which is self-explanatory.

Tutorial 3 is now complete.  Tutorial 4 will cover more features of the K framework, in particular how to exhaustively explore the behaviors of non-deterministic or concurrent programs.
