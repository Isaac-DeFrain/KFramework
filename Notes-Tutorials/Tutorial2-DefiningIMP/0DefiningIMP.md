# Part 2: Defining IMP

In this tutorial, we will learn how to define a very simple imperative language in K and the basics of how to work with configurations, cells, and computations.  Specifically, we will learn the following:

* How to define languages using multiple modules
* How to define sequentially strict syntactic constructs
* How to use K's syntactic lists
* How to define, initialize, and configure configurations
* How the language syntax is swallowed by the builtin K syntactic category
* The additional syntax of the K syntactic category
* How the strictness annotations are automatically desugared into rules
* The first steps of the configuration abstraction mechanism
* The distinction between structural and computational rules
